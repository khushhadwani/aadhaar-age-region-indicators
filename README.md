Age-aware and region-sensitive analysis of Aadhaar enrolment and update data
# Age-Aware and Region-Sensitive Indicators using Aadhaar Data

## Overview
This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment, demographic update, and biometric update datasets
to identify age-driven and region-specific service demand patterns.

## Problem Statement
Raw Aadhaar counts do not directly reveal service behaviour.
This work introduces simple, interpretable indicators to support data-driven administrative planning.

## Datasets
- Aadhaar Enrolment Dataset (age-wise)
- Aadhaar Demographic Update Dataset
- Aadhaar Biometric Update Dataset

(Note: Raw datasets are not included due to data usage policies.)

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and aggregation
- Age-wise segmentation
- Region-wise indicator development
- Visualization of service demand patterns

## Key Indicators
- Update Pressure Indicator
- Demographic vs Biometric Composition

## Reproducibility
Place the respective CSV files in the following folders:
- enrolment/
- demographic/
- biometric/

Then run `analysis.ipynb`.

## Disclaimer
This repository uses publicly available aggregated datasets and does not contain any personal data.
